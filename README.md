# Dev8 IDE

> Dev8 IDE is crafted to give developers a no-setup, browser-based coding experience with support for multiple languages. Whether you're learning, testing snippets, or building small apps, Dev8 IDE offers a smooth and distraction-free interface.
> Dev8 IDE is free and open to everyone. However, to make the most of your experience—like saving your work, accessing past projects, and managing code across devices—you'll need to sign up or log in. Signing up is quick and easy. Once you're in, you can create, edit, and save unlimited projects securely in your account.
